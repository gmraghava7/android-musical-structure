App structure suitable for a music player

I developed this app as part of the Udacity Code Reviewer traning for the Android Basics Nanonodegree. You can read the requirements for this project [here](https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Beginner%20Android/Musical_Structure.md).

The app is not a funcional music player but rather a "structure that is suitable to be a music player." One of the requirements is to describe add a TextView on each layout with a description of how the activity should work. That's why you'll see a yellow note on top of each layout.

Something new I did on this project was implementing a horizontal scroll list. You can see it on the song details layout for the related songs section. Below some screenshots.
